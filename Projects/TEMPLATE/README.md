This folder contains a blank template for a new project.  It contains the following:

1. 01_rawdata folder
2. 02_programs folder
3. 03_outputs folder  
4. README.md

01_rawdata contains any input files that are needed for the work.  For instance, this may include a csv file containing data that a World Bank colleague shared with you for this project.

02_programs contains all code used to produce the final output.  If multiple scripts are included, please include some sort of documentation on how to run the files in the README.md.

03_outputs contains the final data produced for the project.  Again, this should be in csv form or have at least a copy of the data in csv format.

README.md should contain a brief description of what the project is, how to run the code, and what the final output is.  This doesn't need to be long, but should provide some information.
